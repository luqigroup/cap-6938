    "text": "Description\nThis special topics course introduces modern computational sampling methods for uncertainty quantification in scientific computing and engineering applications. Topics include mathematical and computational principles of classical and contemporary sampling approaches with emphasis on understanding the inner workings of deep generative models, variational inference, and simulation-based inference methods. Students implement sampling algorithms and apply them to uncertainty quantification problems through hands-on programming assignments."

    "text": "Why take this course?\nAI models have recently driven significant advances in various science and engineering domains, yet critical reliability concerns remain: models produce unreliable predictions, lack quantifiable safety guarantees, and their theoretical foundations remain opaque to many practitioners. Current approaches focused on scaling and post-hoc validation cannot systematically address these issues. In this course, you will learn modern uncertainty quantification techniques that not only can be applied widely in various science and engineering domains but also hold the key to designing more reliable AI models. You will go beyond treating generative models, which are key components of modern sampling and uncertainty quantification techniques, as black boxes, understanding and implementing the core mathematical principles that make them work. Through five hands-on programming assignments, you will build these algorithms from the ground up, gaining the deep foundational expertise needed to adapt, debug, and innovate in this rapidly evolving field."
