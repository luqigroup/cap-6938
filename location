## Late "class" policy

<span style="font-weight: normal;">Assignments will be due **5 minutes before midnight (ET) on the due date**.</span>
: - If you can't make it, you can use "late classes":
  - For example, if assignment is due on a Friday:
        - Handing it in Tuesday is 1 late class.
        - Handing it in Thursday is 2 late classes.
  - There is no penalty for using "late classes," but you will get a **mark of 0 on an assignment if** you:
        - **Use more than 2 late classes** on the assignment.
        - **Use more than 4 late classes** across all assignments.
  - If you are working in a pair, **you both must have late classes remaining**.
- **No further extensions will be given.**
