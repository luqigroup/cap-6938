## Description

This special topics course introduces modern computational sampling methods for uncertainty quantification in scientific computing and engineering applications. Topics include *mathematical and computational principles* of classical and contemporary sampling approaches with emphasis on **understanding the inner workings of deep generative models**, **variational inference**, and **simulation-based inference** methods. Students implement sampling algorithms and apply them to uncertainty quantification problems through hands-on programming assignments.

## Prerequisites

Students should have background in probability theory, linear algebra, and programming. Familiarity with deep learning basics is recommended but not required.

## Textbooks

There is no required textbook for the class. A list of recommended papers will be provided during the course.

## Grading
- Programming assignments 60%
- Paper presentation 15%
- Final project 25%
- There will be 2% extra credit for submitting teaching evaluation, if more than 80% of students submitted the evaluation


## Tentative schedule

Course material will be posted on the website before each lecture. *The instructor reserves the right to alter this schedule as needed.*
